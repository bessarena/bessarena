# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Bessa
## Iâ€™m a developer passionate about technology and innovation, with experience in web development. I enjoy creating efficient and creative solutions for complex problems.

ðŸ’» Technologies I Use the Most:

- Languages: **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**
- Frameworks: **Bootstap, SASS, Tailwind and React**
- Tools: **Figma and Git**

ðŸ”­ Featured Projects:

- <mark>Netflix if it owned IMDB</mark> ([repository link](https://github.com/bessarena/odin-project)): I love movies and sometimes I want to watch a good movie with good reviews and I have to change apps. What if Netflix owned IMDB and could sort movies by rating?
- <mark>Weeakly Learner</mark> ([repository link](https://github.com/bessarena/odin-project)): Website that suggests a new topic or skill to learn each week, encouraging continuous personal growth. It aims to keep users engaged by offering fresh and diverse learning opportunities regularly.

ðŸŒ± Always Learning: Currently, Iâ€™m exploring more about Tailwind.
